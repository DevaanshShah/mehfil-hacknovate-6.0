🚀 Problem Statement
The current live entertainment ecosystem suffers from fragmentation—venues, artists, and audiences operate in silos. Event planning involves manual coordination, lack of discoverability, and inefficient workflows.

💡 Our Solution
Mehfil is a Tri-Party Marketplace designed to:

Connect Location Managers (who list venues), Artists (who propose show ideas), and Customers (who browse and book tickets).

Provide Dedicated Dashboards for each role:

🎯 Admin: Approve events, manage users, view analytics.

🏢 Location Manager: List venues, manage bookings and capacity.

🎤 Artist: Submit event concepts with media uploads.

🎟 Customer: Discover, filter, and book events.

🔄 Workflow Example – Booking a Comedy Show
Artist Submission: Uploads event details with images & videos.

Venue Listing: Manager lists available dates and venue capacity.

Event Approval: Admin reviews and publishes the event.

Customer Discovery: Users browse events by date, genre, or artist.

Ticket Booking: Secure payments and confirmations.

Live Show: All stakeholders coordinate for a successful event.
